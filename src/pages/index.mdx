    ## About

    I'm a software engineer living in the Bay Area,
    and I currently work at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
    I studied at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/),
    where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science
    (with an emphasis in networking/graphics and computer systems, respectively).
    Companies I completed internships at include [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/),
    Stripe, and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
    I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant
    in the [Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems](https://www.cercs.gatech.edu/www.cercs.gatech.edu/index.html)
    under Dr. Calton Pu and in close collaboration with Rodrigo Alves Lima.

    My past research work revolved primarily around distributed systems and observability,
    and how to build tools that can _effectively_ instrument production systems.
    In my work in CERCS, I developed and ran experiments
    with a novel resource utilization monitor called
    [rAdvisor](https://github.com/elba-docker/radvisor),
    which was designed to collect high-granularity time-series data
    for the resource utilization of
    [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and
    [Kubernetes pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)--all with minimal overhead.
    At Datadog, I designed and implemented a novel monitoring daemon
    to monitor HTTPS traffic from [Go applications](https://go.dev/) in-memory &amp; before encryption,
    using [Linux eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) and Go runtime/compiler internals.

    In my free time, I enjoy web development and graphic design,
    and have contributed to a small handful of open source projects.
    During my time at Georgia Tech, I worked as a maintainer on
    [GT Scheduler](https://github.com/gt-scheduler/website),
    an open source scheduling application used by GT students
    that seeks to improve upon the course registration process.
    I also enjoy playing computer games and keeping up with esports.
    At Georgia Tech,
    I was an officer and then president of the Esports club,
    where I worked with campus administrators and external companies
    to secure sponsorships, host and plan events
    ([like Gamefest](https://web.archive.org/web/20190511140843/https://gamefest.gg/)),
    and organize resources for competitive teams.
