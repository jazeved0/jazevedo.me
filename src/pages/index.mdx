  ## About

  I'm a software engineer living in the Bay Area,
  and I currently work at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
  I studied at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/),
  where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science.
  Companies I completed internships at include [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/),
  Stripe, and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
  I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant
  in the [Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems](https://www.cercs.gatech.edu/www.cercs.gatech.edu/index.html)
  under Dr. Calton Pu and in close collaboration with Rodrigo Alves Lima.

  My past research work revolved primarily around distributed systems and observability,
  and how to build tools that can _effectively_ instrument production systems.
  In my work in CERCS, I developed and ran experiments
  with a system resource utilization monitor called
  [rAdvisor](https://github.com/elba-docker/radvisor),
  which is designed to collect high-granularity time-series data
  for the resource utilization of
  [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and
  [Kubernetes pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)--all with minimal overhead.
  At Datadog, I researched and implemented a proof-of-concept
  for a touchless HTTPS traffic monitor for [Go applications](https://go.dev/),
  heavily utilizing [Linux eBPF functionality](https://ebpf.io/)
  and Go runtime/compiler internals.

  In my free time, I enjoy web development and graphic design,
  and have contributed to a small handful of open source projects.
  During my time at Georgia Tech, I worked as a maintainer on
  [GT Scheduler](https://github.com/gt-scheduler/website),
  an open source scheduling application used by GT students
  that seeks to improve upon the course registration process.
  I also enjoy playing computer games and keeping up with esports.
  At Georgia Tech,
  I was an officer and then president of the Esports club,
  where I worked with campus administrators and external companies
  to secure sponsorships, host and plan events
  ([like Gamefest](https://web.archive.org/web/20190511140843/https://gamefest.gg/)),
  and organize resources for competitive teams.
