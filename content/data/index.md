I’m an aspiring software engineer and researcher living in Atlanta.
I study at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/)
where I'm a current Master’s in Computer Science candidate,
and in the past I have completed internships at
[MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/),
and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
I’m currently working as a research assistant
in the [Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems](https://www.cercs.gatech.edu/www.cercs.gatech.edu/index.html)
under Dr. Calton Pu and in close collaboration with Rodrigo Alves Lima.

My research interests revolve primarily around systems and observability,
and how to build tools that can _effectively_ instrument production systems.
In my work in CERCS, I developed and ran experiments
with a system resource utilization monitor called
[rAdvisor](https://github.com/elba-docker/radvisor),
which is designed to collect high-granularity time-series data
for the resource utilization of
[Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and
[Kubernetes pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)--
all with minimal overhead.
At Datadog, I researched and implemented a proof-of-concept
for a touchless HTTPS traffic monitor for [Go applications](https://go.dev/),
heavily utilizing [Linux eBPF functionality](https://ebpf.io/)
and Go runtime/compiler internals.

In my free time, I enjoy web development and graphic design,
and have contributed to a small handful of open source web applications.
Most recently, I have worked on adding additional major features to
[GT Scheduler](https://github.com/gt-scheduler/website),
an open source scheduling application used by students at Georgia Tech
that seeks to improve upon the course registration process.
I also enjoy playing computer games and keeping up with esports.
During my undergraduate years at Georgia Tech,
I was an officer and then president of the Esports club,
where I worked with campus administrators and external companies
to secure sponsorships,
[host and plan events](https://web.archive.org/web/20190511140843/https://gamefest.gg/),
and organize resources for competitive teams.
