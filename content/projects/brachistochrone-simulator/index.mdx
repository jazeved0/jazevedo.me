description: Java iterative physics simulator for exploring the historic Brachistochrone Problem originally posed by Johann Bernoulli in 1696
lead: 'Iterative calculus-based simulation with accompanying <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenGL-powered</a> graphics display program designed to verify relative performance of different solutions to the historic <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BrachistochroneProblem.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Brachistochrone problem</a>. An accompanying report was written in LaTex which gives simulation results and a mathematical explanation of a rigorous solution.'

## üèÅ Results

With a _Œîx_ of 5 meters and a _Œîy_ of -3 meters, the following results were derived for the time it takes for the mass to get from _A_ to _B_, _t<sub>AB</sub>_, in seconds: (Note that for the final results, an extremely small _dt_ was used in order to attain a high level of approximation: for this, _dt_ = 1/960,000 sec or 1.04167 √ó 10<sup>-6</sup>)

| Curve           | _t<sub>AB</sub>_ (sec) |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `StraightTrack` | 1.5116                 |
| `CircularTrack` | 1.2679                 |
| `CycloidArc`    | 1.2616                 |

Using basic physics calculations, the time it takes for an object to travel from the start of a 5 √ó 3 meter frictionless ramp can be found to be approximately **1.52031 seconds**, making the predictions derived via simulation supposedly within only a **0.57%** error.

## üìÉ Write-Up

A LaTeX document detailing the Brachistochrone problem, one of its solutions, and the results of the computational model is [available here](https://jazevedo.me/projects/brachistochrone-simulator/report.pdf). It was originally produced to be pasted onto a poster for the [UTC Mathematics Poster Competition](https://www.utc.edu/mathematics/pdfs/poster-competition-rules-2018.pdf) in 2018.
