In Februrary 2019, I was contracted by
[AXR Edge](https://www.axredge.com/) (formerly known as Axis Replay)
to design and develop a new website built on Wordpress
*(note: the website has since been redesigned)*.
My main responsibilities included designing and developing a custom Wordpress theme
for the new website, as well as designing new branding guidelines for digital media.
I worked closely with stakeholders over the course of several months to iterate on the design
and reach a product that the client was happy with.
This process utilized UI mockups made in
[Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html),
which also evolved into a short digital branding style guide to accompany the website design.

My work on the development of the website included:
- Ensuring the site was responsive and mobile-friendly
- Writing jQuery code to handle various UI interactions
- Integrating the
  [Google Maps Embed API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started)
  to display a map of the company's primary location
- A full-screen social media "wall" that displays the latest posts
  from the company's social media accounts,
  to be displayed on a large screen in the the company's office
- Short sections of PHP code to handle including common files in a modular way
- A substantial amount of configuration of Wordpress plugins to handle various features of the website,
  such as the event calendar, contact form, ticket purchasing system, and the social media wall

## Screenshots

Below is a gallery of screenshots from areas of the website that I designed and developed.

## Branding guidelines

The following collection of design elements consistitutes the digital branding guidelines
that I compiled and developed for the company.
These were made in tandem with the UI mockups,
and served as the basis for the final website design
(as well as other digital branding elements made by the company).

Note that neither me nor this site is endorsed by or directly affiliated with AXR Edge
(formerly known as Axis Replay).
The use of these branding elements is included here only as an example of my work
in developing a digital brand identity,
and should not be confused for any association with the company.
