description: Event website for GT Esports' annual LAN, featuring third party payment embedding and custom jQuery multi-view Twitch client
lead: "The frontend was built with jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap to display event info, with a small, mostly static backend running on an Apache webserver. The website used a third-party tournament service <a href=\"https://smash.gg/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Smash.gg</a> to handle payment and registration</li></ul>, and featured an AJAX-powered multi-view Twitch client to display multiple broadcasts."
